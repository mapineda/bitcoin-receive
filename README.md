## Bitcoin-Receive

Bitcoin program used to receive money built with javascript and Bitcoin Core.

## Getting Started

# Install Node.js

You first need to download an installer for Node.js from the http://nodejs.org/ website.

When you run the installer for Node.js, it will also install the Node Package Manager (npm) that we’ll rely on next.

# Install node-bitcoin

Now you’ll need a JavaScript library that connects to Bitcoin Core and bitcoind. We’ll use the node-bitcoin library. To install node-bitcoin, go to a command prompt and enter

` npm install bitcoin `

This command invokes the (previously installed) Node Package Manager, which downloads everything in the library in a simple step.

# Download Bitcoin Core
Download Bitcoin Core from the official website https://bitcoin.org/en/download

## Starting Bitcoin Core
Next, you need to fire up Bitcoin Core in server mode. The wallet app will open an extra socket that we’ll use to connect to the wallet from our JavaScript program.
